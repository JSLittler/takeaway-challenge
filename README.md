#takeaway challenge - John Littler
#written in ruby, with rspec testing
#All necessary gems recorded in gemfile

#Notes:
#100% test coverage, however one test requires manual input of options 1, 6 during the rspec process. Didn't have time to figure out how to do this automatically, though I think I'm half way there.

#My commits have been erratic on this project, initially because I really wasn't happy with my code and didn't see a benefit in keeping too much of it as I intended to re-write once I had a functional model.

#The final commit on 15-10-2018 @ 1:30am has been heavily refactored, partly for this reason and partly to increase testability.

#As a priority I have focussed upon using delegation among classes, and demonstrating doubles in the testing process.

#I have not done the bonues challenge. This seemed like a lower priority than maximising the quality of other parts.

#I did have a little help for Clare Jolly on the SMS confirmation aspect. Clare was very kind, and I was in a rush so that I could ensure I was able to obscure my details prior to leaving makers on Friday, in case of any problems.

#Having not prioritised the confirming order aspect, this code has not been re-factored in any way, and the test for it is weak at best. Clearly I'm going to have to do some more work in this area in the future.
